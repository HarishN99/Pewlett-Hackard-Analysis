## Summary: 


### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

Based on the data 72,458 employees at Pewlett-Hackard are reaching retirement age, therefore this can be expected to be the number of roles that will need to be filled as the “silver tsunami” begins to make an impact on the company. 


### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

There were a total of 1549 employees who were eligible to participate in the mentorship program to mentor new employees at the company. However, this may not be enough to mentor all the incoming employees hired to fill the roles of those retiring. Under the assumption those 72,000 roles will be filled with new hires, spreading mentors evenly, the ratio will be close to 1 mentor for every 47 new hires. Therefore, it is important to act with consideration to the limited supply of qualified, retirement-ready employees in relation to the incoming new employees. 

### Discussion

Looking at employees nearing the age of retirement, it may be beneficial to select for salaries and create a table displaying this information. This can provide an idea on the range of salaries new employees hired to fill these roles will be expecting. To create the table, the “salary” column can be included from “emp_info” or “salaries” and included in a table such as “retirement_titles”. 

Of those nearing retirement age, displaying results for those who are in manager/senior level positions will also show roles that can be filled through promotion of staff currently on the payroll. This table can be created with a “WHERE” looking at titles, specifying for positions such as “Manager”, “Senior Staff”, “Senior Leader”, and “Senior Engineer” to name a few.
